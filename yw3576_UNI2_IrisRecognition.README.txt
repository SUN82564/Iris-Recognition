I. Whole Logic of design

For this project, we are provided with CASIA Iris Image Database (version 1.0) which contains 108 classes of eyes. Each class has been grouped into 2 folders, from which we will use the first folder as training data and second folder as testing data. The main task was to match iris correctly to its belonged class.

Before the the main task, the first step is image preprocessing which tranforms the image into a form that can be conveniently used in later steps. This preprocessing step leads to identification of area of interest(the iris region), transformation of the region into a rectangle that's easy to analyze, enhanced image with high contrast and removed noises like eyelashes. 

Next, we extract features from the preprocessed images with the method defined in Ma'S paper using the same parameters. It combines Gabor Filter and a modulating function that can best capture the texture of each iris. It uses two channels of filters, and each picture finally results in a feature vector of length 1536.

After capturing the features, we will maximize the class separation with LDA and match iris with class number. 

We will evaluate the performance of the overall method using correct recognition rate (CRR) and ROC curve.

II. Limitation of current design

The accuracy rate we obtained is around 75%, there is still room for improvement. 

Fisrt of all, the data we have is limited; therefore, enlarging the sample size will test this design in a more comprehensiive way. 

Second, in the preprocessing part, we did not detect eyelid nor did we remove it in the normalization procesure. This potentially has a negative impact on the performance. 

Third, we tested different parameters and thresholds in the irislocalization, and found that adjusting it could influence the results. Therefore, by finding the best overall parameter, the result can also be optimized. 

Fourth, this experiment design does not have the ability to identify fake iris.
